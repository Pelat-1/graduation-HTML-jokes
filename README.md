# Graduation HTML Jokes

##### FOR FRANCESCO CALISE

This project aims to create a series of HTML pages as a graduation joke.

Before start coding your jokes you **must** read this Markdown.

# 1. WRITING A JOKE

You just have to write HTML pages and js files, no css files are allwed.

You write only your page(s) and you should not use the ``index.html`` name, it is reserved.

Each joke must have its own js file and you should call it from the ``js`` directory.

# 2. GIT FLOW

Here you must use git-flow too, it's simple.

You can use add, commits, fetch, pull & push commands as usual.

To start using git-flow just type ``git flow init``.

If you want to write a joke you must use the command ``git flow feature start MY-FEATURE-NAME``.

Substitute MY-FEATURE-NAME with the name of your own feature, a name that helps others to understand
which kind of joke you are working on, in this way there will not be twice the same joke.

When you want to merge your code just use the command ``git flow feature finish MY-FEATURE-NAME``.
